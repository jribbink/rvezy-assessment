## Technologies
### Vue 3
While I prefer Angular, I chose Vue as it seemed fitting when applying to a frontend Vue position.
### Bootstrap
Helps implement grid system amongst basic styling in a time crunch
### Eslint/Prettier
Configured ESLint with Prettier plugin
### Typescript
While I 100% understand that TypeScript is overkill for this project (and probably just makes things more complicated), it was done for example purposes to show my ability to configure npm projects as well as ability to use TypeScript if necessary.  Similary to linting rules
### Webpack
